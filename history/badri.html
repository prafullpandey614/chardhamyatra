      <h4>History about Badrinath</h4>
      <div id="tguide">As per Hindu belief, Badrinath came to light when Nar-Narayan, an avatar of Lord Vishnu, did Tapasya there. At that time, this place was full of berry trees, and in the Sanskrit language, Berries mean Badri. Therefore, this place was named as Badrika-Van due to the abundance of Berries trees. Badrinath temple is a particular spot where Nar-Narayan did Tapasya, and a large berry tree saved him from rain and sun.

        Local people believe that Mata Lakshmi became a tree to save Lord Narayan. After completing the Tapasya, Narayana said people will always take her name before him. Hence we always refer to Lakshmi-Narayan. All these happened in Satya Yuga, and therefore it is considered the first Dham. It comes in both Chota Char Dham yatra and Bada Char Dham Yatra circuits. The meaning of Badrinath is Lord of Berry forest.

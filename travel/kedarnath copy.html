        A holy city, nestled in the Himalayas, it is one of the Char Dhams, and is home to arguably one of India’s most revered temples. Situated in a stunning backdrop, Kedarnath can only be reached by a 16 km trek from Gaurikund. It is a widely celebrated religious and tourist destination, offering jaw-dropping views of the surrounding natural beauty. Due to the extreme conditions, the city is shut off to the public for nearly six months. Tourism thrives in Kedarnath primarily from May to June.  In 2013, this spiritual hub was badly damaged by flash floods. However, it has started to regain its old charm over the last few years and is still a must-visit destination.
